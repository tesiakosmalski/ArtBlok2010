I have learned a lot this semester. Though, I'm not completely sure how to describe my digital literacy. I think that it means
how much do I know about different technologies, how deeply do I know how to effect them. There seems to be a range of my
literacy with all these different avenues. But, I think its the themes that informs the literacy that I will take with me.

What are my research questions that I am going to take with me?
What do I know now vs. what did I know then?
What themes have I detected?
Embodiment-including the body
Meaning Making
Dynamic Delivery
Fabric of Digital Life
I need to take a critical scholarly view..

The intersection of digital technologies and the body is very important. As more sophisticated codes
programming and devices continue to evolve, its important to understand how we live and breathe,
how it is that seamless integration works.

  Experiences in fabric helped this too. As we unpacked keywords and aligned on groupings for things, I think we were trying to gather the patterns and meaning behind directions that exist or directions that we'd like to see.
  In the end, the greatest lesson in Fabric is this: that meaning still needs to be made by people that see a healthy narrative in all things.
